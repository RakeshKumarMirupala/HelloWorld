The issue in `prodn3` server (`sd-734c-50be.nam.nsroot.net`) seems to be the **missing `BabyProfile_T` file**. According to the logs, the script is looking for `/opt/ofbatch/N_ofdata/BabyProfile_T`, but this file doesn't exist. In contrast, in the successful `prodn1` server (`gftsoafinmwap5pn1`), `BabyProfile_T` exists as a symbolic link to `/opt/ofbatch/T_ofdata/BabyProfile_T`.

To resolve the issue on the `prodn3` server:

### 1. Verify the expected `BabyProfile_T` file or symlink:
- Check if `/opt/ofbatch/T_ofdata/BabyProfile_T` exists on `prodn3`. Run:
  ```bash
  ls -ltr /opt/ofbatch/T_ofdata/BabyProfile_T
  ```
  If the file exists, create a symbolic link for `BabyProfile_T` in `/opt/ofbatch/N_ofdata`:
  ```bash
  ln -s /opt/ofbatch/T_ofdata/BabyProfile_T /opt/ofbatch/N_ofdata/BabyProfile_T
  ```
  This will resolve the missing file issue.

### 2. If the target file doesn't exist:
- If `/opt/ofbatch/T_ofdata/BabyProfile_T` is missing, copy the file from the working `prodn1` server:
  ```bash
  scp ofbatch@gftsoafinmwap5pn1:/opt/ofbatch/T_ofdata/BabyProfile_T /opt/ofbatch/T_ofdata/
  ```
  Then create the symbolic link as mentioned in step 1.

### 3. Validate the permissions:
- Ensure that the permissions on `BabyProfile_T` match those on `prodn1`:
  ```bash
  chmod 775 /opt/ofbatch/N_ofdata/BabyProfile_T
  chown ofbatch:oafin /opt/ofbatch/N_ofdata/BabyProfile_T
  ```

### 4. Test the job:
- Rerun the job after resolving the issue and verify the logs for any further errors.

By ensuring the symbolic link or the file `BabyProfile_T` exists in the correct location, the script will no longer fail on the `prodn3` server.
