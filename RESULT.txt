**Subject:** Clarification on Additional Script Found During Deployment  

Dear Team,  

During the deployment of the `obBRCsms` package for the `20250106` release on the DEV server, I noticed a discrepancy between the scripts listed in the release wikipage and the actual deployment.  

According to the wikipage, the following scripts were expected:  
- `func_CitiBR`  
- `shrun_CitiBRCosmosGLFeed.sh`  
- `shrun_CitiBRLDWFeed.sh`  
- `run_CitiBRCollFeed.sh`  
- `run_UpdateDBStatistics.sh`  

However, after taking changes from the `develop` branch and deploying, an additional script, `run_CitiBRCosmosGLFeedBlocked`, was found, which is not mentioned in the wikipage. Below is the diff output for reference:  

```  
bash-4.2$ diff -qr 43.38.D0 43.38.C0  
Files 43.38.D0/share/run_CitiBRCosmosGLFeedBlocked and 43.38.C0/share/run_CitiBRCosmosGLFeedBlocked differ  
```  

Could you please confirm if this script is intended for this release? If yes, it would be helpful to update the wikipage accordingly.  

Thanks,  
Rakesh
