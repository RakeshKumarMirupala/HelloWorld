Subject: Thank You and Farewell - My Last Day at Virtusa
Dear All,
Today marks my last day at Virtusa after 4 wonderful years, and I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who has been part of this journey.
Working on the Oasys Financial project for Citi has been an enriching experience that has shaped my professional growth tremendously. Each day brought new learning opportunities that prepared me for the unexpected.
I would like to thank my Virtusa Project Manager, Srirama Evani, and my Line Manager, Shweta, for their guidance and support throughout my tenure.
Special thanks to the Citi team - Santosh Shukla, Mihir Khanwalker, and Akash Pawar - for their leadership and mentorship. Your expertise and willingness to share knowledge have been invaluable.
To my wonderful team members - Chandu, Suresh, Srilatha, Laxmi, and Ram - thank you for your collaboration, support, and friendship. It has been a pleasure working with such talented individuals on L3 support and release deployments.
As they say, "Change is the only constant thing in this universe." While it wasn't an easy decision to move on, I take with me invaluable experiences and memories from our time together.
I wish you all continued success and hope our paths cross again in the future.
Thank you for everything!
Warm regards,
[Your Name]
