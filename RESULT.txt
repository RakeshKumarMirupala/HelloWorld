**Subject:** Request to Unfreeze Check-in for Jan 20th - 24th Due to Leave Entry Issue  

Dear [HR Name],  

I hope you are doing well.  

I am facing an issue with my check-in system related to my **Comp Off leave on January 17th, 2025**. I had utilized my **Comp Off leave** on that day but mistakenly recorded it as **Work from Home (WFH) request** instead of marking it under the leave category in the check-in timesheet. Due to this inconsistency, the system is preventing the unfreezing of my check-in for the week of **January 20th - 24th**, even after the approval of my unfreeze request.  

Since this is causing a **Loss of Pay (LOP) for January 2025**, I kindly request your assistance in unfreezing my check-in for **January 20th - 24th** so that I can enter my leave details correctly. Please let me know if any further action is required from my end to resolve this issue.  

Looking forward to your support.  

Best regards,  
Rakesh Kumar Mirupala
